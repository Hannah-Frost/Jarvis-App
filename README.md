# Jarvis #

  This cross-platform phone app uses React Native.js and Expo CLI to provide a personal assistant that will create a daily report using your calendar events, live weather / temperature based on your location, and personalised name and work destination. The daily report can be read aloud to the user, allowing for a convenient hands-free alternative to switching between multiple apps for the same data. This app was produced as our final engineering project at Makers Academy within a timeframe of 9 days.

## Setting-Up and Viewing in Expo
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install node modules by running `npm install` in the command line.
3. Create an API key at the [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) website.
4. Create a .env file in the root of the app.
5. Add this API key into the .env file under `APP_ID=insert_API_key_here`.
6. Run `npm start` in the command line to start the the development server.
7. Install the [Expo client app](https://expo.io/) on your phone.
8. Connect to the same wireless network as the computer running the development server.
9. Open your project:

**Android:** use the Expo app to scan the QR code from your terminal.

**iOS:** use your camera app to scan the QR code from your terminal. You will be prompted to enter the Expo app if the scan was successful.
